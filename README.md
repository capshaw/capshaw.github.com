==================

What is this nonsense?
----------------------

The content of my personal website. I figured I'd make it open source :)

Some Details
------------

For now this is purely a static site. I had previously to this point utilized a content management system that I created a few years back (affectionately called Citrus CMS) which allowed me to post dynamic content. Since I have grown out of that code and needed a clean slate, I decided to start with this, a site with no dynamics. Over the next few months, I hope to grow it into a new and dynamic site.
