==================

Hey! You've stumbled upon the source code for [my personal website](https://capshaw.me).

This site is built on two major preprocessors, Jekyll and SASS, and is self-hosted on [RamNode](http://www.ramnode.com/). There's not much else here!

Feel free to poke around or even steal the source code for your own personal site. I redesign my site quite often, so checkout on the [releases](https://github.com/capshaw/capshaw.me/releases) for this repository to see those old designs.
