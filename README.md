==================

This is the code for my personal website. My site used to be quite heavy and dynamic, but since that time I have stripped it down and found simplicity to be superior. Plus it's not like I was ever going to actually blog ;)

Repo Name Change
----------------

Was once named `andrew-capshaw-com` but was changed so that github pages could be utilized.
