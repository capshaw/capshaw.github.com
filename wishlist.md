# Wishlist

<div class='info'>
    Hey! Just so you know, this is mostly a list of things that I want to purchase in the future &ndash; and not things I expect other people to get for me. You can probably use it to get an idea of the sorts of things I'm currently into though. I'll also try to keep plenty of less expensive things on the list.
