Andrew Capshaw
==============

Education
-------------------------

Was really easy! I already had a repo called `andrew-capshaw-com` that held my personal website. There were only three steps required in order to change from my previous hosting to the github pages hosting: (1) Rename the repo `capshaw.github.com` (2) Add a CNAME entry to the repo and (3) Changing the DNS settings to point to github's servers.

Thanks to <a href='http://www.saltesta.com'>Sal Testa</a> for the suggestion.
