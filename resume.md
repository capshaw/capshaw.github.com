### The Greedy Painters
Utilized HTML5s canvas and Javascript to create a visual simulation. Users select the number of painters and walls to be placed and let the simulation run (painters can be added and removed in real-time). The greedy painters wander the map looking for untouched blocks to paint. The user can watch real-time statistics such as number of blocks painted and efficiency to monitor the simulation.
