It’s raining outside and I’m listening to DIIV’s album *Oshin*. Sometimes there’s nothing better than sitting around and doing nothing.

I like music a lot. However, I really, really, *really* dislike listening to music that doesn't fit my mood. Or listening to music that doesn't fit the tone of the moment.

Inspired by today's rainy weather, here are some perfect rainy day albums that I like listening to when holed up during a storm:

- DIIV's *Oshin*
- Beach House's *Thank Your Lucky Stars*
- Jónsi's *Go*
- Real Estate's *Atlas*
- Purity Ring's *another eternity*

Until the next sunny day!
