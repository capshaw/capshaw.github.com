Today is election day and I'm ready for it to be over.

Over the last half year, I've grown increasingly annoyed by the political pandering and lack of solid content during debates and rallies.

The debates this fall felt more like reality television, and less like an interview between two frontrunners vying for one of the most important jobs in the United States.

I find myself wishing our political system was a little different:

- I wish that debates were more about the content. More *logos* and less *ethos* and *pathos*. I want to see numbers. I want to see graphs. I don't want to hear lies. I don't want to hear people talking over each other and the moderator.
- I wish our system supported more parties and more diverse ideas. Certain topics get way more attention than they should (Abortion, for example), while others are completely forgotten because they don't win elections (mass incarceration and the drug war for example).
- Election day should be a weekend on holiday. Everyone should be encouraged to participate. The idea that it should be on a Tuesday because people required Monday to travel is antiquated and irrelevant.

I'm sure there are more things I could add to the list, but those are what jump out at me immediately.

Regardless of all this – it is worth exercising one’s right to vote.
