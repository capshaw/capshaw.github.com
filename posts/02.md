Do most adults stop dreaming when they "grow up"? Yesterday I had a good talk with a close friend about the interplay between needs, desires, and something larger than both: societal progression.

I postulated that most adults only ever have time to worry about the first two. On a day-to-day basis a vast majority of us (myself included) only have time to worry about feeding ourselves, clothing ourselves, going to work, working, and finding restful sleep before the next day of the same.

On weekends, most of us are just trying to recover from the work week.

These issues that we deal with on a day-to-day do not progress society as a whole (I admit that for work it depends wholly on the purpose of company). These are mostly personal issues and business issues.

They don't solve global warming. They don't solve inequality. They don't solve racism.

There's so much wasted potential.

As our society gets larger, as we transition from continental cultures to a world-wide culture, how do we focus on larger an larger issues? How do we get to a multi-planet culture? How do we get out of our solar system? How do we mitigate unknown threats from the universe?

Eventually these issue will become larger than any one person can understand. (Maybe we're already there!)

It'll be tempting to ignore these issues. We'll regret that.
