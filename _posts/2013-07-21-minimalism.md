The less clutter there is in my life, the happier I am. I've been noticing and thinking this over a lot lately. Whether this "clutter" is measured in the amount of stuff I own, the way I structure my code, or the number of tasks on my todo list, the less there is, the better. The cleaner and clearer my surroundings are, the easier it is for me to interact with them.

A lot of my thinking on this subject comes as I prepare to move. For a lot of people, moving is a pain: the pure amount of *stuff* they have to transport is overwhelming. Even the amount of stuff I am moving is pretty annoying. Here, owning less is clearly an advantage if one is concerned about mobility.

Beyond moving, owning less also makes life a lot easier in other ways: cleaning is certainly easier when there are less things to clean and my bank account is happier with fewer places to drain away to. Spending more money on fewer things means that the quality of those things can be higher. Here the clich√© phrase *quality over quantity* comes to mind.

I believe the biggest positive to come out of owning less is a subjective feeling that comes from the minimalistic aesthetic. While I can't explain this very well, my ability to think in a clean, empty room is often better than if that room were dirty.

It could be the lack of distractions or the way the room becomes more lit up, but the subconcious difference between the two environments can surprisingly affect my mood and respectively, my productivity.

The physical sphere isn't the only place where I have found minimalistic tendencies to be of help. When it comes to writing code, less is often more.

The ability to whittle down logic into a more pure statement can usually make code more understandable, and thus maintainable.

Just to be clear, I'm not advocating anything crazy such as single letter variable names. But the less clutter there is to read through and the way in which the code structured can make a world of difference when trying to understand someone elses (or past you's) code.

In this vein of thinking, I used to have refactoring code. It's done! It works! Why should I rewrite the logic and potentially break it? As I've grown more as a developer (can I call myself that now?), I've gained a huge appreciation to what refactoring code can do for the maintainability and readability of code.

My life right now certainly could not hold up as the poster child for minimalism. Not even close. I own a lot of stuff I don't use. And I've written my fair share of bulky code.

Nonetheless, I strive to find some path of least resistance where more often than not, more is not the answer.
