TODO: proofread

I have a confession: I haven't read a book for pleasure in years. The only books I've touched since coming to college are textbooks and other non-fiction (ethnographies and coding guides) for class. I'm looking to change that by reading *Outliers* by Malcolm Gladwell during the coming week of Rice's spring break.

I used to love reading. In middle and high school, I would read at every opportunity I got, attempting to finish in-class assignments as quickly as possible so that I could whip out my book and get a few pages of reading in.

I read a huge number of books in high school. I probably read a fiction work or two a month. Now I haven't managed to read a book in years. The last book I finished to completion was Orwell's *1984*, a book I read the summer before heading off to my first year at Rice.

So what changed since then? The immediacy and speed at which I can browse the internet.

My high school didn't allow computers or phones in-class very often. Some of the teachers didn't care, but most did. Because of this, reading was my past-time of choice.

This limitation of the internet, and the fact that the school's system was so slow disuaded me from spending very much time on the internet at school. Reading was a much more immediate way to escape.

At home the reasons were much the same: my family shared one central desktop, a wired internet connection, and a laptop. This meant that browsing the internet required being out in the living room and that everyone could see your browsing habits.

Since then, my family has finally upgraded to wireless internet, but not until I left the house. Now I live on my own in an off-campus apartment. I have "unlimited" access to our own wireless gateway to the internet from the comfort of my own room. When it comes time to choose what I want to do, I can either have the immediate gratification of the internet, or the long-term gratificaction of the book. It's hard not to choose the former.

Because of this, my reading habit tapered off when I went to college. Since the first year of my time at Rice, I have attempted to read several books, but have yet to finish one to completion. All have been abandoned within the first one-hundred pages.
