I'm still loving my new camera. Here are some shots I took at my Grandmother's apartment. I really like the way the camera and lens handled the sunny rooms.

{% include image.html file_type='jpg' image_url='/static/photos/2014-12-25-grandma-1' alt='Empty chair and vase.' %}
{% include image.html file_type='jpg' image_url='/static/photos/2014-12-25-grandma-2' alt='Very nice flowers in bloom.' %}
{% include image.html file_type='jpg' image_url='/static/photos/2014-12-25-grandma-3' alt='The four blankets: Emory, Brown, Rice, Brandeis' %}
{% include image.html file_type='jpg' image_url='/static/photos/2014-12-25-grandma-4' alt='A very orange pillow.' %}

I think the camera does some HDR behind the scenes. If I was trying to take a calculated shot I'd find a way to turn this off, but I think it's good for most daily use.
