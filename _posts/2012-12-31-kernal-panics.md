title: On Kernal Panics
---

My computer started having hourly kernal panics a while back. In case you don't know what a kernal panic is, a kernal panic is a irrecoverable error that an operating system cannot safely recover from. So it just restarts. (I hope you saved your data!)

As one might imagine, this is a very annoying problem.

What's Up
-----------

I'm not certain the exact cause of the panics themselves, but they seem to happen primarily (if not exclusively) when browsing the web with Chrome and Firefox. Whether this is because I spend most of my time browsing the web or because the kernal/browser interaction is buggy is anyone's guess.

The Solution
------------

Buy a new computer (haha). But really, my solution thus far has been to use Safari. Not an optimal solution, but I have yet to have a kernal panic when browsing with Safari. This is especially sad since Chrome &gt; Firefox &gt; Safari.

To me this suggests that the problem is a software problem (related to the interaction between the on-board graphics and Chrome/Firefox), but I can't be sure. All I can do is hope that my computer doesn't restart as I type this sentance.
