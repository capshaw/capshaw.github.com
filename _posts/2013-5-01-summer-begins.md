My junior year is coming to an end. I just turned in my final paper, and am still recovering from pulling an all-nighter two nights ago. I decided I should write about what I learned from the past two semesters, lest I forget. Here's a short list of some things I learned:

+ *Living off-campus is worth it.* I was afraid that living off-campus might have been a bad decision. But the pros definitely out-weighted the cons for me. Making my own food, being able to sleep on Saturday nights, and the cheaper price all outweighed the commute. Plus that will make the transition from college to post-graduation life that much easier.
+ *Instant coffee isn't worth it.* My girlfriend gave me a French press as a present this year and making coffee with it has been a lot of fun. Takes up a lot less space than a coffee-maker, a huge plus in my opinion!
+ *Learning about Art History makes visiting art museums fun.* Whenever I had been to a modern art museum before this semester I walked around in a state of uncertainty: Does this art really have meaning? Inevitably I didn't really ever enjoy those experiences. Now, after taking a class on *The Renaissance through the Present* this semester and learning about the movements and ideals that fueled various artists, going to the museum became a lot more interesting. Being able to think about how the different movements interact make the museum setup interesting since you are able to see the different styles in comparison.
+ *Life's too short to waste time on the Internet.* Still something I'm coming to grips with but I'm getting better. If I find myself wasting time on the internet I try to do something more productive, such as reading or learning guitar.

I'm sure I learned other things over the course of the previous two semesters, but I'm at a loss currently. Maybe I'll append a few more items to the list at a later time. I'm looking forward to working here in Houston this summer and my final year of school next starting next semester! It's scary and exhilarating to think about the future.
