These are the notes for Art History II: The Renaissance to the Present. Just keeping them on the web so I can easily access them. 

## Week One

### January (Limbourg Brothers, 1413-1416, France)
+ Part of a international gothic style 
+ Hints of naturalism / renaissance styles
+ No perspective / flat tapestries in the background
+ Very busy and colorful
+ Otherworldly / long tall fingers / tall, thin fingers
+ Patrons liked conspicuous consumption
+ No shadows

### Adoration of the Magi (Gentile da Fabriano, 1423, Florence)
+ Alter piece with a gothic frame
+ Gold leaf instead of paint is very Gothic
+ A continuous narrative - same characters appear more than once in the story (a feature that is cross-art-period)
+ No real light source a / a pale white mercurial light across the panels 
+ "Magical lighting" and glow to the figures
+ Compared to the later pieces, the respected figures are shown with flaws as well (people in the parade are in commotion - not at peace)

### Florence
+ City states with agricultural income (Feudal - think pyramid)
+ Conspicuous consumption is popular
+ Feudal transforms to capitalistic, merchant society with a merchant class
+ Medici family
+ Interest in maps and travel
+ Move from bible/gothic to interest in psychology and ethics and morals
+ Return to the roman ideas
+ "rebirth" of antiquity (returning to works like Cicero and regaining an interest in history)

### Humanism
+ Interest in antiquities
+ Includes interest in government and moral life
+ How to organize family
+ How to be moderately political (and philosophical)
	
### The Tribute Money and The Expulsion of Adam and Eve (Masaccio, 1427, Florence)

#### The Expulsion of Adam and Eve
+ Kept simple as a throwback to gothic
+ First cast shadows in art in a thousand years
+ Figures are stable on the ground
+ Covering face causes viewer to project into the image
+ Throwback to anchient Roman reliefs/figures
+ Made it clear it was a sexual fall

#### The Tribute Money
+ Introduced idea of sketchy (flowy) painting
+ Tax scene (moral: money doesn't matter)
+ Not international gothic 
+ Everyone is stoic / noble which reflects on the quality of the characters (compare to the Adoration of the Magi)
+ Standing firmly on the ground
+ Tax collector: weak, not sturdy, aloof, short robe

### Ten Naked Men (?, ?, ?)
+ `Engraving`, allowed multiples, spread of ideas across Europe
+ Subject: Low state of society some time in antiquity (perhaps barbarians from Roman times)
+ Alberti: never show twisted body, never show arms above head (both considered unnatural)
+ Very angular people
+ Alberti likes smooth art, graceful (not angular)

## Week Two

### The Dead Christ (Mantegna, Milan, 1500)
+ Christianity strengthened by renaissance art 
+ Stations of the cross (little booklets that told people how to relive the suffering)
+ `foreshortening` portray or show (an object or view) as closer than it is or as having less depth or distance, as an effect of perspective or the angle of vision: seen from the road, the mountain is greatly foreshortened.
+ Enlarged head on purpose (going against known perspective)
+ Very hard robes like aniquity's statues

### The Birth of Venus and Primavera (Botticelli, Florence, 1482-1486)

#### The Birth of Venus
+ Made for the Medichi family
+ Intentionally play off of Apelles' work of the past (from ancient Greece) 
+ Girl on right is Pomona (goddess of fruit), Hora, or Nymph
+ Venus's mother was the sea
+ The heavenly "pure" venus versus the sexual venus
+ Embondies some ideas of international gothic: Elongated figures and hair, Gold powder used, Detached / calm face, Crafted water, Antigravitational, Roman garments heavy versus the gothic sway

#### Primavera
+ More gothic revival
+ Very flowery / tapestry-like / dream-like
+ Venus / three graces / cupid / mercury
+ Ovid Metamorphoses
+ Oranges / balls as Medichi *signature*
