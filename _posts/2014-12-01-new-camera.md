These are some of the first photos I took with my new camera -- a Sony Alpha A6000. I am excited about the portability of this mirrorless camera.

I was especially surprised about how well the lighting came out in this dark setting. My last camera did terrible in low light so this will really open up a lot of options for creativity. Hopefully many more photos will come out of it!
