I really like cooking. So much so that I would rather live off-campus and cook for myself than to either live on-campus or buy a meal plan. (I sometimes forget that people at other universities <em>actually like</em> to move off-campus. At Rice, the popular thing to do is stay on.)

Well anyways, one of my favorite dishes of all time was Fire Bowl Cafe's General Tso's Chicken. To a lot of people, it is probably nothing special, but I have fond memories of the spicy dish. Lately, I've been looking for a vegetarian/vegan alternative. I just ran accross a really good recipe, I thought I would try posting a recipe here. Here goes nothing!

Ingredients
-----------

<ul>
    <li>
        Half a cup of Soy Sauce
    </li>
    <li>
        A spoonful of chili garlic sauce
    </li>
    <li>
        Three carrots
    </li>
    <li>
        A head of Broccoli (are they called heads?)
    </li>
    <li>
        A cup of Sugar Snap Peas
    </li>
    <li>
        One package of tofu, cut into large pieces (you'll later cut this down smaller)
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href='http://allrecipes.com/recipe/mamas-asian-chicken-and-rice/'>Mama's Asian Chicken Sauce</a> minus the chicken and the orange flavoring.
    </li>
    <li>
        A cup of rice
    </li>
</ul>

Steps
-----

<ol>
    <li>
       Start marinating the tofu in the mixture of the soy sauce and the chili garlic sauce. You'll want all sides to be rotated through the marinade for a grand total of around ten minutes (too long and the tofu will be quite salty).
    </li>
    <li>
        Wash and cut your vegetables into small chucks while waiting for the tofu. You aren't going to want to do this later, so do it now. Small is good because it allows the vegetables to cook faster.
    </li>
    <li>
        Bake the tofu on a baking pan for 30 minutes at 375 degrees, flipping once half-way. In the meanwhile, you can start the sauce if you'd like.
    </li>
    <li>
        Once the tofu is done, start some rice cooking.
    </li>
    <li>
        Cut the tofu into long, thin, strips.
    </li>
    <li>
        Start cooking the tofu in oil on the stove. Once you feel it is crispy enough, toss in the veggies and start stir frying. When the vegetables look done, add the sauce to the pan. You're done, enjoy!
    </li>
</ol>

Now this is the first time I've ever made the recipe, but it turned out really well. If I make it and update it in the future, I'll post so here!
