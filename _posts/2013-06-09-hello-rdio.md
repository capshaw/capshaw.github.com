About two weeks ago, I decided to abandon Spotify for Rdio. I had considered doing so before then, but didn't make the switch until now. Perhaps for my own sanity, I have decided to outline why I think Rdio is better than Spotify for the time being. I also just felt like writing something :p

## The benefit of being a web app.

The Spotify client is installed. This has its benefits, like being able to listening to imported files on one's own computers. In comparison, Rdio's app is web based, and thus can be accessed on any machine without much hassle. I find the latter of the two benefits to be the more compelling of the two. MORE

## The UI and its effect upon music discoverability.

Putting aside all differences in content and/or functionality, it would be hard to say that Spotify looks better than Rdio. The user interface on Rdio is well thought out and makes the experience of discovering new music enjoyable.

While to some, this difference might seem shallow, I found that Spotify's sucky UI often hindered my experience with their app. Let's say I was attempting to find new music on Spotify. How do I discover new music? Two of the main ways that Spotify promotes are their "home page" album listings and installed plugins. [both sucked]

## Less Annoying

+ Spotify ads
+ Install every time something goes wrong
+ Horrid color of green their logo is
+ Installed app

## The new kid on the block.

+ Spotify hasn't seemed to change much (on my side)
