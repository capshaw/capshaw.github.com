    Hello, I'm Andrew!
  </h1>
  <p>
    I am a software engineering manager in Austin, TX. 
  </p>
  <p>
    When not at work, I try to spend as much time outside as possible: running, hiking, or just relaxing in a nice park.
  </p>
  <p>
    Across the web, you can find me reading on <a href="https://goodreads.com/capshaw">goodreads</a> and lurking on <a href="https://twitter.com/AndrewCapshaw">twitter</a></li>.
