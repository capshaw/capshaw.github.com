        Hi, I'm Andrew.
    </p>
    <p>
        I’m a software engineer located in Austin, TX.
    </p>
    <p>
        When not writing code, I’m outside hiking, running, or exploring the world. Often I bring along a <a href="https://photos.capshaw.me">camera</a> or a <a href="https://goodreads.com/capshaw">book</a>.
        Sometimes I <a href="https://508bce.com">write</a> things.
    </p>

        Feel free to poke around at <a href="https://github.com/capshaw">personal projects</a>
        or check out my <a href="/resume">resume</a>.
