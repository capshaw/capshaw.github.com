<h1>Hi, I'm Andrew.</h1>
<div class='break-short'></div>
<p>
    I'm a rising senior in the computer science department at Rice University in Houston, TX.

<p>
    While I am primarily a developer, I enjoy building with an emphasis on the user experience. In my free time, I make music, hike the trails of central Texas and attend local concerts.
