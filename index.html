    Hello, I'm Andrew!
  </h1>
  <p>
      I am a software engineering manager in Austin, TX. 
  </p>
  <p>
      In my professional life I aim to build products that make people's lives better.
  </p>
  <p>
    When I'm not at work, I try to spend as much time outside as possible, running, hiking, or just relaxing in a nice park.
