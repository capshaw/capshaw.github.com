        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>I'm currently a senior in my final semester at Rice University in Houston, TX. I'm capable working anywhere within the software anywhere, but I really enjoy honing my skills on the front-end.</p>
        <p>In May, I'll be moving to Austin, TX after graduation. I look forward to starting my first full-time job then!</p>
