            <h1>Hello! I'm Andrew. I'm a developer living in Houston, TX.</h1>

            <p>On this site, you can find various experiments that I've built. Besides building things, I enjoy pretty much everything outdoors. Random fact: my favorite type of plant are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succulent_plant">succulents</a>.</p>

            <p>If you would like to get in contact with me, my email is <a href="mailto:capshaw@rice.edu">capshaw@rice.edu</a>.</p>

            <h1>Projects</h1>

            <p>In my free time, I like to create things. Below are some of them! Most of these projects are open-source on <a href="https://github.com/capshaw">Github</a>.</p>
            <ul>
               <li><a href="/sudoku">Sudoku</a>, a sudoku puzzle generator and solver. Motivated both by the UI challenge and to learn how sudoku puzzles are generated.</li>
               <li><a href="/maze-factory">Maze factory</a>, one of my earlier experiments with the HTML5 canvas. It draws a DFS-generated maze to the screen live in front of the user.
               <li><a href="https://github.com/capshaw/budget-tracker">Budget Tracker</a>, built to allow roommates and friends to easily track and manage collaborative budgets. Built on a Python + Flask backend.</li>
               <li><a href="https://github.com/capshaw/GeneralCluster">General Cluster</a>, an application for displaying data and finding clusters using k-means clustering. Built on Java.</li>
            </ul>
