# Hello! I'm Andrew. I'm a developer living in Houston, TX.

On this site, you can find various experiments that I've built. Besides building things, I enjoy pretty much everything outdoors.

<!-- Random fact: my favorite type of plant are [succulents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succulent_plant). -->

If you would like to get in contact with me, my email is [capshaw@rice.edu](mailto:capshaw@rice.edu).

<!-- Ugly. Too bad there's not a better way to do this. -->

# Projects

In my free time, I like to create things. Below are some of them! Most of these projects are open-source on [Github](https://github.com/capshaw).

+ [Jellyfish](https://github.com/capshaw/jellyfish), a personal note and document application to make the writing and maintaining of markdown notes and essays painless. Built on a Flask backend.
+ [Sudoku](/sudoku), a sudoku puzzle generator and solver. Motivated both by the UI challenge and to learn how sudoku puzzles are generated.
+ [Maze Factory](/maze-factory), one of my earlier experiments with the HTML5 canvas. It draws a DFS-generated maze to the screen live in front of the user.
+ [General Cluster](https://github.com/capshaw/GeneralCluster), an application for displaying data and finding clusters using k-means clustering. Built on Java.
