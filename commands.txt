Some cool random, helpful commands I can never remember since I don't use them that often.

# Hide or show hidden files / folders on a mac
defaults write com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE
killall Finder

# cURL a page repeatedly
for i in {1..1000}; do curl URL; done

# Show hidden files temporarily in Ubuntu 
CTRL + H
