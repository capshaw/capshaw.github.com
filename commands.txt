defaults write com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE
killall Finder

defaults write com.apple.screencapture disable-shadow -bool true

for i in {1..1000}; do curl URL; done

# Show hidden files temporarily in Ubuntu 
CTRL + H

# Apache error log location when attempting to fix .htacess problems 
tail -f /var/log/apache2/error.log
