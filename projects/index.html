<h2>Sudoku</h2>
<a href="http://capshaw.me/sudoku" class="project-image" style="background-image:url('/img/projects/sudoku.png');"></a>
<p>
    A sudoku generator and solver that I built during a couple of spare weekends in the summer of 2013. Written as an entirely client-side alternative to a very early PHP sudoku solver I wrote many years ago. The project utilizes SASS for a maintainable stylesheet and the module design pattern for javascript maintainability.

    An HTML5 web application that paints a maze to a canvas. Built to explore using the new canvas element with live animation.
